> ``The Eighteenth International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA 2019) will be held at Boca Raton, Florida, USA on December 16-19, 2019.
ICMLA 2019 aims to bring together researchers and practitioners to present their latest achievements and innovations in the area of machine learning (ML).
The conference provides a leading international forum for the dissemination of original research in ML, with emphasis on applications as well as novel algorithms and systems. Following the success of previous ICMLA conferences, the conference aims to attract researchers and application developers from a wide range of ML related areas, and the recent emergence of Big Data processing brings an urgent need for machine learning to address these new challenges. The conference will cover both machine learning theoretical research and its applications. Contributions describing machine learning techniques applied to real-world problems and interdisciplinary research involving machine learning, in fields like medicine, biology, industry, manufacturing, security, education, virtual environments, games, are especially encouraged."
