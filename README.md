### Posters @ ICMLA

The conference will include poster sessions, which will allow authors to present their work to a wider audience and which will provide an opportunity for discussions and networking. The posters can be up to 36" wide and 44" tall. Materials will be provided for mounting your poster. The posters will be displayed throughout the conference in one of the two scheduled poster sessions.  The schedule for the poster sessions will be available on the conference web site in late October.
